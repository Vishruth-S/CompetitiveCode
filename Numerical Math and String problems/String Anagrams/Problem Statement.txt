Q. Taking input of two lines or Strings from the user, compare and 
find if they are anagrams of each other or not.

What are anagrams?
Two statements with the same alphabets used the same no. of times but
irrespective of spacing in words.

Ex.
INPUT1: I LOVE COMPUTERS
INPUT2:	MOLE COVERS IT UP
OUTPUT:	YES
LOGIC:	they're just rearrangement of the used alphabets.
	hence they are anagrams.

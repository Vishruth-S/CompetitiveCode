Q. Taking input of two lines or Strings from the user, compare and find if they are anagrams of each other or not.

What are anagrams? Two statements with the same alphabets used the same no. of times but irrespective of spacing in words.

Ex. INPUT1: I LOVE COMPUTERS INPUT2: MOLE COVERS IT UP OUTPUT: YES LOGIC: they're just rearrangement of the used alphabets. hence they are anagrams.

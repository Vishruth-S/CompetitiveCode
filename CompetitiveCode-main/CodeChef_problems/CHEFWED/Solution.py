'''
Some basic explanation for the approach:

Assume that thereâ€™s just one table initially which has all the guests sitting on it.
Now, this arrangement might not have the minimum inefficiency. 
So, we consider all the possible arrangements and choose the one with the minimum inefficiency.

Basically, we minimize the inefficiency by splitting the guests into two parts and assigning one table to the first part.
Then, for the second part, we again try to minimize the inefficiency by following the same steps until we have no guests remaining.

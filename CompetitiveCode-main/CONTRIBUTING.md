## Important Note: READ THIS BEFORE SENDING A Pull Request

The idea is to collect different solutions/logic in different languages to some of the popular CP questions.  
Read the following points carefully
* The `problem` file should only contain either the link to the problem OR the problem itself. DON'T add anything related to the solution in the `problem` file.
* In your `solution`, **ADD THE LOGIC USED FOR SOLVING IN THE FORM OF COMMENTS EITHER ALONG WITH THE CODE or AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CODE.**
* The logic MUST be in the `solution` file and NOT in `problem` file
* **More emphasis is given on understanding the logic used to get the solution rather than the code itself.** Hence simply copy-pasting code is not encouraged.  

As long as your PR adheres with all the points mentioned above, you're good to go :sparkles:

Happy contributing :smiley:

### Problem statement

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

### Example

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

### Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (js)
[input] array.integer inputArray

An array of integers containing at least two elements.

### Constraints:
2 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 10,
-1000 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 1000

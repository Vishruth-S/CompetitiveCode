# working
    # uses Logical operators to add 2 numbers
    # for example considering the case a = 2, b = 4
    # binary representation of 2 is 010 and binary representation of 4 is 100
    # xor'ing 010 with 100 we get 110 which when converted to int gives 6

    # we have to notice xor gives output with either of the input is 1
    # so in case 2 ^ 2 we would get 0 which is wrong
    # to solve this we need to take consideration of carry bit too which can be done using the Logical AND function

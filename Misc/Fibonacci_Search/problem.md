Fibonacci Search

Given a sorted array arr[] of size n and an element x to be searched in it. Return index of x if it is present in array else return -1.
Examples:

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40}, x = 10
Output:  3
Element x is present at index 3.

Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40}, x = 11
Output:  -1
Element x is not present.
Fibonacci Search is a comparison-based technique that uses Fibonacci numbers to search an element in a sorted array.


Fibonacci Search examines relatively closer elements in subsequent steps. So when input array is big that cannot fit in CPU cache or even in RAM, Fibonacci Search can be useful.
Background:
Fibonacci Numbers are recursively defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1. First few Fibinacci Numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, â€¦




Observations:
Below observation is used for range elimination, and hence for the O(log(n)) complexity.

F(n - 2) &approx; (1/3)*F(n) and 
F(n - 1) &approx; (2/3)*F(n).

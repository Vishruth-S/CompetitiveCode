Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

Example:<br>
Input:<br>
array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]<br>
Output:<br>
True

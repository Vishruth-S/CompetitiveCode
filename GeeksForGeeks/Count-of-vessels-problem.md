#Count of vessels completely filled after a given time


Given two integers N and T denoting the number of levels and the number of seconds respectively, the task is to find the number of completely filled vessels after T seconds under given conditions:

   A structure of vessels of N levels is such that the number of the vessels at each level is equal to the level number i.e 1, 2, 3, … up to N.
    Each vessel can store a maximum of 1 unit of water and in every second 1 unit water is poured out from a tap at a constant rate.
    If the vessel becomes full, then water starts flowing out of it, and pours over the edges of the vessel and is equally distributed over the two connected vessels immediately below it.

Assumptions:

    All the objects are arranged symmetrically along the horizontal axis.
    All levels are equally spaced.
    Water flows symmetrically over both the edges of the vessel.

Last Updated: 25-05-2020
Given an unsorted array of nonnegative integers, find a continuous subarray which adds to a given number.
Examples :

Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5}, sum = 33
Ouptut: Sum found between indexes 2 and 4
Sum of elements between indices
2 and 4 is 20 + 3 + 10 = 33

Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 10, 5}, sum = 7
Ouptut: Sum found between indexes 1 and 4
Sum of elements between indices
1 and 4 is 4 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 7

Input: arr[] = {1, 4}, sum = 0
Output: No subarray found
There is no subarray with 0 sum
